# Library for calculating parameters of $2\omega_p$ radiation generated by counter-propagating lasers in plasma

![counter-propagating_lasers](counter-propagating_lasers.png?raw=true)

Radiation is the result of nonlinear interaction of counterpropagating plasma wakes excited in a uniform plasma by short laser drivers with equal wavelengths.  In a homogeneous
plasma, purely potential Langmuir waves are excited by these drivers.
Scattering of the first potential wave (which perturbs the longitudinal velocity $\delta v_{1x}$ ) on the density modulation
$\delta n_2$ produced by the second wave (and vice versa) results in forced oscillations of the longitudinal electric current $\mathcal{J} \propto \delta n_2 \delta v_{1x} + \delta n_1 \delta v_{2x}$ at the doubled plasma frequency
$$
(k_1, \omega_p) + (- k_2, \omega_p) \rightarrow (k_1 - k_2, 2 \omega_p).

The figure is interactive. One can vary values of $a_{01}$, $a_{02}$ and move a point on the efficiency map with other plots as well as parameters in the box being recalculating.
